## Project Overview
Developed during **Agglomeration 2024** (IIT ISM Dhanbad's hackathon), Clear Horizons is an innovative solution for early myopia detection through comprehensive vision analysis and lifestyle monitoring.

## Key Features
### Vision Assessment Suite
- Snellen Test (Visual Acuity Measurement)
- Astigmatism Dial Test
- Blur Sensitivity Analysis
- Posture Tracking via Webcam
- Screen Distance Monitoring

### Data Collection Parameters
| Category          | Metrics Collected                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Vision Tests      | Acuity scores, Astigmatism patterns, Blur thresholds |
| Behavioral Data   | Screen distance (30-100cm), Sitting posture, Screen time |
| Lifestyle Factors | Outdoor activity duration, Reading lighting conditions |
### Machine Learning Model
- Used Random Forest to predict whether the user have myopia or not.
- Random Forest has unique benifits like, it achieves superior predictive performance through ensemble learning, combining multiple decision trees to reduce variance and errors.
- Actually the data would be huge and there would be high variance, and for classification model **Random Forest** model best suites for high variance dataset
